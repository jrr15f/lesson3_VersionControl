            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a system that records files over time. This allows the user that uses a Version Control System to go to a previous version of the file. This is very helpful if you need to show your progress on a file, or if you deleted something that you need to retrieve later. This system also give you creative control to change anything you want without having to worry about losing the previous look or layout of the files. This is interesting and useful as a student and in this course. Sometimes you want to change the way a website looks, without having to worry about not being able to put it back to the way it was.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The local version control system is used by many. Local in this instance, refers to the computer. The user will write a file and save it, then after some changes to the file, the user can save the file again under a new name. Usually the user will title it by date, time, or just number the saves. It isn’t always the best because it can difficult to remember which saves have what in them. I think this is useful in this class and in my other classes, because I usually use this way of saving my files. It works well for me, but I think it might not be the system for this class, which has a lot of changes.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The centralized version control system helps to make collaboration with others much easier. This system allows multiple users to “check out” files, edit them and then save them back to the system. This is like the local version control system in the way it saves files. The downside of this system is that if the server the files are stored on is offline, nobody can access them. Another downside is if the one place they are stored is corrupted, then everyone loses everything. This is interesting because it shows the progression from local to central version control. This may be useful in this course if multiple students need to collaborate on an assignment.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The distributed version control system is very similar to the centralized version control system. The difference between the two is that the distributed version control saves the files on the server as well as keeps an active copy on every computer that accesses the files. This is the most secure way because if the server goes down, or if it becomes corrupt, an active copy from any of the computers can be used. This is very interesting because it continues the progression that was made going from local to central to now distributed. This is useful in this class because we can share our work on a system like this. Git is the distributed version control system well be using all the time in this course.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Compared To Other VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is different from other Version Control Systems. Other version control systems keep their file saves like files. They see each save as a new file and put it in line with the other files that were previously saved. Git does this process differently, Gits saves aren’t just files on top of each other, Git looks at each file and only saves what is new, forming a file. If nothing is changed in a new save, then nothing is added. If only a little is changed then only the changed parts will be saved into the file. This makes it much more efficient. Git is useful in our class because it is the best VCS. It is efficient and easy to use, it’s also good to know how to use Git in future professions we may have. </p>
