## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A Version Control System record files over time.
2. A Local Version Control System is used to save a file on a local system (personal computer).
3. A Centralized Version Control System is used to let more than one person access a file.
4. A Distributed Version Control System is used like a CVCS except it stores a copy of the files on the computer of everyone who accesses them.
5. Git is different from other VCS in the way it saves. It only saves changes, not entire files.
